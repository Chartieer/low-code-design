`window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`

https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-devtools-inline

https://github.com/bruderstein/react-render-hook

https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-polyfills/client

Now can't run if React Devtools Extension is installed due to this issue:
https://github.com/bruderstein/react-render-hook/issues/4

But can run in incognito mode

No need for react-render-hook or devtools! Can get line, source file info from event.\_targetInst.

Babel generate seems to remove new lines, so may need a different parser - CST? https://github.com/cst/cst

Maybe try plain old regex and split. No need for babel anymore, just convert file to an array using split('/n')

Need to build tree now
